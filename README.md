# Interactive Dashboard

A hobby project to test Dash (https://dash.plotly.com)

I have used the data from Norges Bank's portal and used a python framework FastAPI (https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) to create a couple of end points to query that data. 
This repository uses the api to query data on dashboards.
